For generating the Matrices, we took inspiration from the last Exercise (sheet 3) and fitted it to our requirements.
We took into acount, that it should be possible to not just multiply sqare matrices.

We use OpenMP to splitt matrix A into "task packages" for the processes to wich we broadcast matrix B and scatter matrix A.
After multiplying, the results are gathered and result matrix C is put together.

We used ChatGPT for some ideas and explanations of MPI Commnands, but coded everything by hand.

One Problem in our Implementation is, that the Size N of Our Matrix C (NxN) has to be divisible by the Size of our MPI Comm World.
If this is not the Case, the Matrix does not get split correctly, and unintended behaviour is observed.
