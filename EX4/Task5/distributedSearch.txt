For the last Task, we first searched for a MPI-functionality to stop or interrupt the processes when the searched value would be found.
We did not find any solution that seemed good enough for us to use. 
Therefore, we decided to simply split the array and let each process search in it's own segment. We made a second array, which contains only '0's.
We marked the indecies in this new array, if they contain the given value, with a '1'.

Because of our approach for searching all occurrences of the given value in the array, there were no best or worse cases.

As was the case is the previous Task, the Array Size has to be divisible by the Comm World Size, or unintended behaviour is expected.
